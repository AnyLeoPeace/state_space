# Improve the Attentive State-Space Model

This is the code to improve the Attentive model in the Attentive State-Space Modeling of Disease Progression paper.

## To use
1. Run *compare_main.py* to get the comparison results between the proposed model and the Attentive model under different proportion.
2. Run *plot.py* to plot figures.
